## Visualisation of Unicon Companies using Tableau

I decided to apply my newly attained tableau skills on an interesting dataset that I found on Kaggle!

A unicorn company, or unicorn startup, is a private company with a valuation over $1 billion. As of March 2022, there are 1,000 unicorns around the world. Popular former unicorns include Airbnb, Facebook and Google. Variants include a decacorn, valued at over $10 billion, and a hectocorn, valued at over $100 billion.

From analysing the data on indiviudal sheets using different visualisation tools such as treemaps to creating an interactive dashboard for users to delve deeper into specific industries, I was able to extract key insights with the given data.
